# kineKit

## Overview

Set of tools for acquiring kinematics using [DeepLabCut (DLC)](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut), which allows for automated tracking of the coordinates of landmarks. 
We hope to make these tools approachable for investigators with no prior knowledge of python coding. 
There are numerous ways of using DLC and other tools that we feature, but we're going to recommend a particular workflow with software selected for the task. 

At this stage, we are interested only in single-animal experiments, but intend to implement the ability to extract 3D coordinates from experiments using 2 or more cameras. 
DLC runs most effectively on a desktop computer with a high-powered NVIDIA GPU, but some components of our workflow can be managed on a laptop and the project can be transferred over to the desktop for the serious number crunching. 

The following links provide details for each aspect of the kineKit workflow:
